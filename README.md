# Kiki's Keg House
### By Joseph Tubridy

## Description

This is a react applcation that displays and tracks the beverages available at a fictional tap house.  It was created to practice using state.  An individual can add their own beverages, and serve drinks, which reduces a counter indicating standard drinks remaining in that keg.
